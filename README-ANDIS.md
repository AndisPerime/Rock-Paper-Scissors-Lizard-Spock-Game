## About Andis

This was my first hackathon and overall this was a great experience to show my skills and work in a team in an agile environment.

## Development Process

### AI Collaboration
During the development of this project, I utilized AI tools (specifically GitHub Copilot) to enhance my development process:
- Used AI for initial code structure suggestions
- Leveraged AI for debugging and code optimization
- Maintained creative control while using AI as a supportive tool
- Carefully reviewed and modified AI suggestions to ensure code quality and functionality

### Technical Implementation

#### Interactivity
- Implemented dynamic button interactions for game choices
- Created responsive difficulty selection system
- Added real-time score tracking and updates
- Incorporated animated visual feedback for user actions
- Developed an intelligent computer opponent with varying difficulty levels

#### Experience Design
- Designed an intuitive user interface with clear visual feedback
- Created engaging animations for choice selections
- Implemented a difficulty system that adapts to player performance
- Added visual cues for game state changes
- Maintained consistent visual styling throughout the application

#### Accessibility Features
- Ensured proper contrast ratios for text visibility
- Added clear visual indicators for interactive elements
- Implemented keyboard navigation support
- Included disabled state styling for buttons
- Used semantic HTML for better screen reader compatibility

#### Responsive DOM Manipulation
- Dynamic updating of game state without page reloads
- Real-time modification of button states based on game rules
- Smooth transitions for visual elements
- Efficient event handling for user interactions
- Responsive layout adjustments for different screen sizes

### Code Structure
The project is organized into several key components:
- CSS styling for visual presentation and animations
- JavaScript for game logic and DOM manipulation
- HTML structure for the game interface
- Asset management for images and other resources

### Future Improvements
Planned enhancements include:
- Additional animation effects
- Enhanced difficulty modes
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Sound effects and background music
- Multiplayer capabilities
