## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a game in a front-end web development environment using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create static web application.

The game consists of a  simple, web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with the idea that the game is played against an AI opponent (Bang).

The main implementation of this classic game adds two new variables, namely Lizard and Spock, to create variety and challenge.

One of the requirements of the project is to implement gradual difficulty, so choosing the number of variables will be the base of our first gradual leveling feature for our MPV, so before starting the game you can choose how many variables you want to use, three or five.


## Features
