## Introduction

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this collaborative project is to create an engaging and interactive game within a front-end web development environment. Utilizing the core technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we aim to develop a dynamic and visually appealing static web application. This project will not only enhance our technical skills but also provide a platform for creativity and teamwork. By combining these powerful web development tools, we aspire to deliver an enjoyable and polished game experience for users.

## Website Purpose

The purpose of this website is to offer a fun and engaging web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors," enhanced with modern twists. Players can challenge an AI opponent named Bang, adding an exciting element of competition. The game introduces two additional options, Lizard and Spock, to enrich the gameplay with more variety and strategic depth.

To cater to different skill levels, the website allows players to select from a number of different levels before starting, effectively setting the game's difficulty. This gradual difficulty feature ensures that players of all ages and experience levels can enjoy a personalized and progressively challenging experience.

## Planning

During the initial project meeting, we focused on key considerations such as user experience (UX), design consistency, and we had some time for brainstorming ideas. 
We discussed the technical setup, including server configuration and repository management. 
Roles were assigned for project manager, front-end development, internal game logic development and UX/UI design. 
The team framework was chosen, with a Scrum Master appointed to facilitate agile practices. This thorough planning set a solid foundation for our collaborative efforts and aimed to deliver a high-quality web application.
